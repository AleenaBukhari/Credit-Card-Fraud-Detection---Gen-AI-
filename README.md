# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection Gen-AI
SecureTrust Financial Services, a financial institution, has asked us to help them improve the accuracy of their fraud detection system. The model is a binary classifier, but it's not performing well due to data imbalance. Through frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras in Python, I have created and trained a Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) to  to create synthetic fraudulent transactions that closely resemble real transactions.
